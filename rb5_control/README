The solution are only two files (src/hw1_solution.py and src/mpi_twist_control_node.py).

mpi_twist_control_node.py
	receive a desired twist and calculate the desired angular velocity for each wheel.

hw1_solution.py
	given a waypoints list, it uses a loop to walk through all way points. In each loop, it sets the current way point as
	the target position and use PID controller to calculate the desired twist for the robot to approach current way point.

To run by following commands in order
roslaunch rb5_control mbot_bringup.launch
roslaunch rb5_control hw1_sol.launch
